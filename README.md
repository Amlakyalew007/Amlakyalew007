### Hi! I’m Amlakyalew Worku, welcome to my project. 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on advance flight control for quad-rotor UAVs.  
- 📚 I’m currently learning Advanced nonlinear control techniques, MATLAB/Simulink, and Python.
- 🤝 I'm looking to collaborate on projects related to robust nonlinear control.
- 🙋‍♂️ I'm interested in combining learning-based and model-based control strategies for nonlinear dynamic systems. Particularly in how data-driven methods can enhance adaptability while preserving the stability and robustness of classical control approaches.
- 💬 Ask me about Robust and adaptive control techniques.
- 📫 How to reach me: amlakyalew.worku@gmail.com
- ⚡ When I’m not designing control systems, you’ll find me vibing to music, enjoying the outdoors, or watching football (and yes! Messi is the undisputed GOAT 🐐⚽). Balance between equations and passions is key!
